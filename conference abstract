egetation hazard is one of the top causes of transmission lines power outages in Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) transmission grids. We used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) approach to quantify the risk of failure of the transmission grid to support the wildfire mitigation planning and prioritization. The model assesses the expected failure risk given the environmental and assets conditions associated with past outage events due to vegetation from 2015-2022.The goal of the a MaxEnt model is to compare the statistical distribution of environmental conditions and asset characteristics associated with outage locations(i.e. Distribution of strike tree heights, conductor size, rainfall averages, fuel dryness etc) to the distribution associated with all the locations along the transmission grid, also called the background. The three categories of data relevant to modeling that process are: (i) asset attributes (ii) spatially varying environmental conditions, determined by location (iii) spatio-temporal varying weather conditions, determined by location and time. The model is trained and tested separately by computing the covariate importance and reviewing the predictive performance metrics. The iterative process was followed to select the best performing covariates. Strike tree covariates were the dominant covariates and  showed good performance for the test data and highlighted the areas of high risk in the past with AUC - area under the ROC (Receiver operating characteristics) value of 0.88. The model prediction is produced at the pixel level (100m by 100m spatial resolution) which is later transformed any planning unit sfor implementation of wildfire mitigation program.
