Bird-caused ignitions occur when birds interact with man-made infrastructure, especially electric power lines, resulting in electrical faults that can spark fires. These incidents are particularly concerning in regions prone to wildfires, where a single spark can lead to devastating large-scale fires. Bird strikes to electric lines are one of the most frequent causes of such incidents, especially in rural or forested areas where power lines run through natural habitats.

The significance of studying bird-caused ignitions in relation to water surfaces lies in the behavior of birds. Many species, especially large birds such as raptors and waterfowl, are attracted to areas near water bodies for feeding, nesting, or resting. This makes power lines near lakes, rivers, or reservoirs especially vulnerable to bird strikes. Understanding the proximity of bird-caused ignitions to water bodies can offer insights into the spatial patterns of these events and help mitigate wildfire risks in such areas.




The ignition counts demonstrated varying responses to weather variables assessed at different spatial scales. Regardless of the temporal scale (daily, monthly, or seasonal), the relationships between weather variables computed across service grids exhibited stronger correlations than those calculated at the ignition grids.
This suggests that the broader environmental context, as represented by service grids, may play a more significant role in influencing ignition events compared to localized factors at ignition sites. Understanding these dynamics could enhance predictive models and inform targeted fire management strategies.


These findings may also reflect bird behavior, as certain species tend to forage or nest in areas with specific weather conditions, potentially influencing their proximity to ignition sources and, consequently, the patterns of ignition events. Understanding these behavioral links could enhance our approach to wildfire risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
